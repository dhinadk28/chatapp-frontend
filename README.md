This project involves building a chat application with authentication functionality, allowing users to register and log in using their email and password. Once logged in, users can create groups and chat with other registered users.

The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to create groups. Users can enter a group name, description, and select other registered users to add to the group. The application will save and display the created groups accordingly.

Once a group is created, users can send messages within the group chat. The chat functionality allows users to send text messages, emojis, and even share files or images. The messages are displayed in a chronological order, providing a conversation-like experience.

To enhance the user experience, the application includes notifications for new messages in the chat groups. Users will receive real-time notifications when new messages are sent in the groups they are a part of. This helps users stay updated with the ongoing conversations.

Furthermore, users have the option to switch between dark mode and light mode, which can be toggled through a UI element. The application saves the user's preference using local storage, ensuring that the selected mode persists across sessions.

The user interface of the application is designed to be responsive, allowing users to access and interact with the chat and groups seamlessly across various screen sizes. The responsive design ensures that the application adapts and provides an optimal viewing and interaction experience on different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

In summary, this project involves creating a chat application with authentication, group creation and chat functionality, real-time notifications, dark mode toggle, and a responsive user interface. Users can register, create groups, invite others, and have conversations within those groups, providing a comprehensive chat experience.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
